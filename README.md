# CS32420 Assignment
2D platform game with a time reversal mechanic. This is the main assignment CS32420 Computer Graphics and Games for 2020-21.

## Building
This is a Unity project, created with Unity 2019.4.14f1. You should be able to open it with a _newer_ version of Unity, but not with an _older_ version.

The project is designed to be compiled to WebGL and hosted online. It can also be built to run on a desktop platform. Other platforms have not been tested, and are not guaranteed to work.

Assets are stored in Git Large File Storage, you will need to pull these down as well as the code. Downloading a ZIP file of the repository will include these LFS assets.
